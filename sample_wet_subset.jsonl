{"text": "When we got to the resort, the Taxify driver said that it would be really difficult for us to find a cab going back (which is true). He said he lived close by so he could hang around and then take us back when we were done. He mentioned that he would pause the ride and then resume it when we were ready to go back. He was going to wait for us for about an hour and a half or two hours so we thought this was a pretty good idea because we didn’t think that we would be able to request another Taxify or Uber at that location because it was far.", "language": "en"}
{"text": "Re: Re:Software cannot make a subjective decision, only a person can do that, and we are back to a gatekeeper model for public speech via publishing something. AFAIK, the only ways to exempt content from contentid is by excluding an account/channel from its reach, or excluding a URI from its reach.Control over publication was justified when it was managing access to limited production and distribution capacity. This however limits free speech by putting a gatekeeper between a speaker and their audience. It however becomes somewhat more problematic when it is used to totally control how and when speech is made available, I.e. TV channels preventing non commercial re-distribution , and when it is is used to limit speech on the Internet because of a small piece of someones content is incidental to the speech, like accidentally captured music.Controlling what when and how something was published, is a necessary evil when physical copies are being produced. It is pure evil when it is is used to control what, when and how on an effectively unlimited Internet. Almost ever piece of speech borrows from copyrighted works, and an automatic identify the bits so that it can be blocked is effectively a means of enabling gatekeepers to control public speech.Improvements to contentid will only increase the works that it tags, as software cannot deal with value judgments required for fair use. Also the people demanding its use do not want fair use to exist, but control over all publishing so that they can make a profit. [ reply to this | link to this | view in thread ]", "language": "en"}

There were many times growing up that I thought I could turn off my attractions to men. I tried so hard. I would punish myself for checking out the lifeguard, fantasizing about my crushes, or watching pornography. It was never physical punishment, but rather reading more scriptures and taking my fun time away. I was serious and I wanted to show God that I wanted to turn off my sinful attractions. I'm even sure that I tried to crush the \"box\" that holds my homosexual desires. Needless to say, I couldn't turn them off or crush bedazzled, glittery, and boa-lined box.", "language": "en"}

{"text": "After an accident I brought my car to Nasca’s body shop to get it fixed, Joe said they would talk to the insurance and deal with them for me, he said they would have some news the other day, I called and he said they still had no information. He noticed my car was a total loss and that he would not make much money so he decided to lie to me and keep my car as long as possible on his lot so he could charge more. After 2 weeks he told me the insurance was coming and I had to sign a release form so they could pick it up. My mistake is that I’m too honest and I fell for the trap, I was signing something that insured that I had to pay for the car for staying there. Now he charged me 1500 dollars and my car is not worth much more than that. I went there to talk to him and he showed his true face, he was very rude and told me to get out of there unless I brought his money. Not happy to steal all that from me he still lied he talked with someone on the insurance company saying they were going there to pick it up next morning; I called the insurance and they never had talked with him. .", "language": "en"}

{"text": "A few paragraphs back, I mentioned that Worf isn’t an expatriate, and that he falls into a different category than the rest of this list. That category is Third-Culture Kids. A third-culture kid, or trans-culture kid, in the real world is usually the child of an expatriate. For example, an American couple has a child while living in Germany. The child is American-born, but German by culture. When the family relocates back to the country of their passports, the child has to deal with this cultural divide. Third-Culture Kids are often multilingual, and are very often accomplished. However, adjusting to their passport country after years of living in other cultures can be incredibly difficult and can take a great deal of time. This is Worf in a nutshell, although he didn’t reintegrate with Klingon culture until very late in his life.", "language": "en"}
{"text": "Can anyone help please? My husband had a TIA in 2010 and was put on statins and aspirin. He was in a very stressful job and had another in 2011. His statins were doubled but he started with leg muscle problems and after a few months, and reading The Great Cholesterol Con he stopped the statins against doctors advice. He was put onto clopidogrel, retired and has been fine ever since except that we have noticed he trips and falls a lot. We just put this down to clumsiness or perhaps the remnants of the statin effects – his legs still tingle and are occasionally painful. However, I came across something that suggested gait problems could be to do with the clopidogrel he’s taking. Does anyone have experience of this? I am wondering whether it would be a good idea to swap back to aspirin or stop it altogether? There’s no point in going to our GP as he already thinks we’re nut jobs.", "language": "en"}

She was about to give up hope, when she shifted her focus from what she could do about it to what she could create concretely with her talent and benefit the company. The result was a document of guidelines for first-time supervisors on how to give performance feedback. She showed concretely what she had learned from the best practices of others as well as her own experience in both mock situations and project settings. As a result, she landed a supervisory job and provided a valuable, tangible asset to the organization for other first-time supervisors to use.", "language": "en"}
{"text": "We stayed here for two nights while visiting Knotts Berry Farm. I was traveling with two teenagers, and we found the room to be very comfortable. We really like that we could easily walk to Knotts Berry Farm, just a few blocks away. We even came back to the hotel part way through our day to take a rest before heading back in the evening. The neighborhood feels a bit sketchy, lots of homeless. But it is also a very busy street, so we did not feel unsafe. I don't think I'd walk it by myself really late at night, though. This hotel has a large outdoor swimming pool, which we did not use. It was always crowded. It has a large indoor hot tub, which we shared with some other guests on our first night. Since it can often get cool and foggy in the evening in California, the hot tub is a nice ammenity. The only real inconvenience was that the hotel did not include breakfast in the price, which many Courtyards do. There was a small coffee bar/counter in the lobby that sold Starbucks and some food, but their hours were sporadic. We slept in a bit on our checkout day, and they were already closed by 10am. There was, however, free coffee and tea in the lobby. There were not really any good breakfast restaurants nearby. In fact, with the proximity to Knotts Berry Farm, it was surprising that there weren't more family-friendly chain restaurants on the strip. We DID eat at Mrs. Knotts Restaurant outside the park for lunch one day. Good meal for the price. The food wasn't anything really special, but you got a lot of it. The leftovers were enough for us to take back for dinner later that night. (And remember, I was with teenagers!) I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted to be near Knotts Berry Farm.", "language": "en"}
